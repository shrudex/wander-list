# WanderList
**WanderList** is a web application built using _React.js_ that allows users to create and manage their travel packing lists. With WanderList, users can add, delete, and check items as packed. The app also provides custom messages based on the status of the items, such as if the list is empty, the percentage of items packed, and if everything has been packed. Additionally, WanderList offers a sort feature, enabling users to sort their items by the order they were added, by item name, or by checked status.

The web app is hosted on **Vercel**, making it easily accessible for users to create and manage their travel packing lists.

## Features
- Add Items: Users can add items to their packing list by specifying the quantity and typing in the item name.
- Delete Items: Users can remove items from their list if they no longer need them.
- Check Items: Users can mark items as packed by checking them off on the list.
- Custom Messages: WanderList displays custom messages based on the status of the items. It provides messages when the list is empty, shows the percentage of items packed, and indicates if everything has been packed.
- Sorting: Users can sort their items based on different criteria, including the order they were added, item name, or checked status.
